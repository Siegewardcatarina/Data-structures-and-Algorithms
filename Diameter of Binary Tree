This file contains the solution to Leetcode Q.543 Diameter of a binaary tree

/*
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

//Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        int dia =0;
        height(root,dia);
        return dia;
    }
    
    int height(TreeNode* root, int &dia)
    {
        if(root==NULL)
        {
            return NULL;
        }
        
        int ld=height(root->left,dia);
        int lr=height(root->right,dia);
        
        dia = max(dia, ld+lr);
        return max(ld,lr)+1;
    }
};
