Q.70 Climbing Stairs

/*
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
*/

//Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n==1){return 1;}
        if(n==2){return 2;}
        int first=1,second=2;
        int result = 0;

        for(int i=2;i<n;i++)
        {
            result = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = result;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
