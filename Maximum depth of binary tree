This file contains the solution to Leetcode Q.104 Maximum depth of binary tree.

/*
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
*/

//Code: 

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        if(root == NULL)
        {
            return NULL;
        }
        return 1+max(maxDepth(root->left) , maxDepth(root->right));
        
    }
};
