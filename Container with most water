Q.11 Container with most water

/*
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

//Code:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) 
    {
        int maxi = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size()-1;    

        while(left<right)
        {
            int volume = (right - left) * min(height[left] , height[right]);
            maxi = max(maxi,volume);

            if(height[left]>height[right])
            {
                right--;
            }
            else
            {
                left++;
            }
        }
        return maxi;
