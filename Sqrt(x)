Q.69 Sqrt(x)

/*
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
*/

//Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x == 0){return 0;}
        int left=1,right=x;
        int res = 0;
        while(left <= right)
        {
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(mid <= x/mid)
            {
                left = mid + 1;
                res = mid;
            }
            else
            {
                right = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
