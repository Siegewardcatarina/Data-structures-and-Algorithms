Leetcode Q.128 Longest Consecutive Sequence

/*
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
*/

//Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> s(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int longest = 0;
        for(auto n:s)
        {
            if(!s.count(n-1))
            {
                int length = 1;
                while(s.count(n+length))
                {
                    length++;
                }
                longest = max(longest,length);
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
};
